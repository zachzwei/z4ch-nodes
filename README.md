## About Me

Hey there, I am **z4ch** AKA **ZachZwei**.&#x20;

I am a crypto enthusiast with more than 10 years experience in the field of Customer Service primarily in Technical Support. My exposure into crypto started around 2017. I worked as a Customer Support Lead / Community Manager at [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) from 2019 to 2022. Some of my notable works was designing their ticketing system and the [Trust Wallet Community](https://community.trustwallet.com/) knowledge base. \

I am no developer, and have no coding background. I am a technician and I figure stuff out. I like creating easy to follow guides and faqs for the average joe.
