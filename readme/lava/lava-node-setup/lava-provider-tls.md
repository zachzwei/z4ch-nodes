# Lava Provider Setup

All providers on `lava-testnet-2` must use a domain name and TLS (1.3). You must have a domain name to continue. If you have not already, please take a moment to purchase one! You can find cheap top-level domains [here](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [here](https://tld-list.com/).

## 📋 Prerequisites

| Required Setup                    | ? |
| --------------------------------- | - |
| acquired a domain name            | ✅ |
| `lavap` is installed & configured | ✅ |
| account with `ulava` balance      | ✅ |

### 🅰️ Change the A Record on your Domain

The first step of establishing your Provider is to modify some of the DNS settings on the domain you purchased. In specific, you'll need to change the A Records on your domain. Changing your `A-Record` will create a subdomain that routes traffic to a specific provider process. Depending upon who you've purchased your domain through, A-Records may be visible under `Advanced DNS` or another label.

<details>

<summary>🖧 Multiple Records (Recommended)</summary>

We recommend you create a separate `A-Record` for each one of the chains that you plan to support. This is more secure, as the default behavior is to refuse connection unless a consumer connects on the correct subdomain.

For each chain you want to support, add an `A-Record` with the desired chain name as the `Host`, the `Value` will be your server IP. For example, if you wanted to support Ethereum & Lava Mainnets, Your DNS Settings should include the following :

</details>

<details>

<summary>⚀ Single Record</summary>

Alternatively, you can create one `A-Record` that captures traffic to all sub-domains. If you are supporting a large number of chains that frequently changes, doing this may somewhat simplify your process.

### 📂 Install Required Dependencies

We will guide you on setting up and configuring Nginx to use a TLS certificate and handle connections to different provider processes. It is also possible to use alternative solutions for these two tasks, such as Caddy, Envoy or your preferred solution.

Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot net-tools nginx python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

\


### 📮 Generate Certificate

Note: ✅ `your-site.com` refers to the Domain name that you purchased and configured.

Next, we need to actually create the `TLS certificate` via the certifying authority. This process is automated by `certbot`.

Use `certbot` to create a certificate:

```
sudo certbot certonly -d your-site.com -d lava.your-site.com -d eth.your-site.com
```

Note, you will need one `-d` flag for each subdomain you created as an `A-Record`. Even if you opted to create a Single Record, you still need to indicate a subdomain for each provider process you will run. We use the filler `you.xyz` as an example above.

You may be met with several prompts. Use `nginx` or Nginx Web Server Plugin when asked.\


### 💻 Validate Certificate

Note: ✅ `your-site.com` refers to the Domain name that you purchased and configured.

Let's make sure your certificate successfully installed! ✅ Input the following command:

```
sudo certbot certificates
```

Keep track of your output. If your certificate generation was successful, it should look as following:

`Found the following certs: Certificate Name: your-site.com Domains: your-site.com eth.your-site.com lava.your-site.com Expiry Date: 2023-11-07 14:37:29+00:00 (VALID: 84 days) Certificate Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/fullchain.pem Private Key Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/privkey.pem`

You'll need both `Certificate Path` and `Private Key Path` for your next step.

\


### 🗃️ Add an Nginx Config for Each Domain

Note: ✅ `your-site.com` refers to the Domain name that you purchased and configured.

Lava recommends running each chain under a separate provider process. This will separate error logs and protect against complete provider failure in the case of a problematic provider process. The first step of this is to create different nginx routes for each chain.

For each chain that you want to support, you will need to create a separate `nginx` config file. `cd` into `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and create a `server` file for each chain. You will need to select an open port for each chain. `Nginx` will use these config files to create your routes.

```
cd
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

Create the server file. For this guide, we will focus on `lava_server`

```
sudo nano lava_server
```

Copy and paste the text below. Save your `lava_server` file.

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name lava.your-site.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/privkey.pem;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/debug.log debug;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2224;
        grpc_pass 127.0.0.1:2224;
    }
}
```

In most cases, after creating a configuration file in accessible sites, you need to create a symbolic link to this file in the enabled sites directory. This can be done with a command like:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/lava_server /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/lava_server
```

The above examples use ports `443` for external listening and `2223` / `2224` for internal comms, respectively. Using ports other than `443` for external listening means that some users will not be able to connect to your provider. This can result in less rewards and poorer quality of service. For internal listening, be aware that some ports on your OS may be used for internal communication and should be avoided.

❗The internal comms port can be changed to any open port on your network.

\


### 🧪 Test Nginx Configuration

Now, ensure that your `nginx` setup is working! ✅

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

🖳 Expected Output:

`nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok`

`nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful`

\


### ♻️ Restart Nginx

You will need to refresh the Nginx server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

\


### ⚙️ Create the Provider Configuration

:::tip Need a template? A default `rpcprovider.yml` configuration is available in `~/lava/config` :::

Per earlier advisement, we'll create one `.yml` per chain we plan to support. Each one of these `.yml` files will function as the configuration for a distinct provider process. In case of our example, we'll create a `lava-provider.yml` and a `eth-provider.yml`.

Create the `lava-provider.yml` file

```
nano lava-provider.yml
```

Copy and paste the text below. Save your `lava-provider.yml` file.

```
endpoints:
    - api-interface: tendermintrpc
      chain-id: LAV1
      network-address:
        address: 127.0.0.1:2224
        disable-tls: true
      node-urls:
        - url: ws://127.0.0.1:26657/websocket
        - url: http://127.0.0.1:26657
    - api-interface: grpc
      chain-id: LAV1
      network-address:
        address: 127.0.0.1:2224
        disable-tls: true
      node-urls:
        url: public-rpc-testnet2.lavanet.xyz:9090
    - api-interface: rest
      chain-id: LAV1
      network-address:
        address: 127.0.0.1:2224
        disable-tls: true
      node-urls:
        url: https://rest-public-rpc.lavanet.xyz:443
```

Once we've created these files we can move onto starting the processes!

* Note:

The urls for `grpc` and `rest` are [provided by Lava](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/public-rpc). If you are running your own Lava node then you can find the following information on the `config.toml` and `app.toml` files located at `./lava/config` folder.

### Where to find ports?

* Tendermint RPC

### 🏁 Start the Provider Process(es)

⏫ To start the Lava provider process

```
lavap rpcprovider lava-provider.yml --from your_key_name_here --geolocation 1 --chain-id lava-testnet-2 --log_level debug
```

Some notes:

* `--from` should be followed by the key name of your funded account that you will use to stake your provider
* `--log_level debug` gives us verbose output so we can diagnose any issues that may arise
* `--chain-id` may or may not be necessary, depending upon your setup, but we can default to `--lava-testnet-2`
* `--node` may or may not be necessary

❗The syntax on your `.yml` files must be precise. Misplaced or invisible characters or inconsistent indentation can cause errors.

\


### ☑️ Test the Provider Process!

Run the following command:

```
lavap test rpcprovider --from your_key_name_here --endpoints "your-site:443,LAV1"
```

🖳 Expected output:

```
📄----------------------------------------✨SUMMARY✨----------------------------------------📄

🔵 Tests Passed:
🔹LAV1-grpclatest block: 0x4ca8c
🔹LAV1-restlatest block: 0x4ca8c
🔹LAV1-tendermintrpclatest block: 0x4ca8c

🔵 Tests Failed:
🔹None 🎉! all tests passed ✅

🔵 Provider Port Validation:
🔹✅ All Ports are valid! ✅

```

❗ Make sure the tests are all passed before you stake your tokens.

### 🔗‍💥 Stake the Provider on Chain

Use a variation of the following command to stake on chain; the minimum stake is `50000000000ulava`

```bash
lavap tx pairing stake-provider LAV1 "50000000000ulava" "lava.your-site:443,1" 1 [validator] -y --from your_key_name_here --provider-moniker your-provider-moniker-1 --gas-adjustment "1.5" --gas "auto" --gas-prices "0.0001ulava" --chain-id lava-testnet-2 --delegate-limit 0ulava
```

Some notes:

* `[validator]` you need to indicate a validator address, choose here: https://lava.explorers.guru/validators
* `--from` should be followed by the key name of your funded account that you will use to stake your provider
* `--provider-moniker` will be the name of your provider

### ☑️ Test the Providers again!

```bash
lavap test rpcprovider --from your_key_name_here --endpoints "lava.your-site:443,LAV1"
```

You can also get useful information on the setup using:

```bash
lavap q pairing account-info --from your_key_name
```

### ✅ Updating Lava Provider

Since you are running `lavap` without `lavavisor` if there are updates necessary, you would have to manually run an update. Here are the steps to do so.

1. Close all running Provider process `CTRL+C`
2. Delete the current `lava` folder and download the most recent version. Check the [latest release](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/releases) available.

```
cd $HOME
rm -rf lava
git clone https://github.com/lavanet/lava.git
cd lava
git checkout <check newest release>
```

3. Build the `lavap` binaries.

```
export LAVA_BINARY=lavap
make install
```

4. Check `lavap` version

```
lavap version
```

5. Run Test to confirm. Then if all test passed, run Provider process.
