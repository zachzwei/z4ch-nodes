# Merge Mining LTC+DOGE+BEL

**Disclaimer**:\
The following guide is based on my personal experience not to be taken as financial advise. Mining cryptocurrencies does not always result to an immediate return of investment. If you understand the risk and would like to know the procedure, then read on.\
The guide covers setting up an account, payment address and configuring your mining pool settings.

### Requirements

\* An [f2pool](https://www.f2pool.com/) account or any mining pool that supports merge mining.\
\* An ASIC cloud mining service like [Nicehash](https://www.nicehash.com/).\
\* A crypto wallet that support LTC and DOGE ([Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)) and BEL ([Nintondo](https://nintondo.io/)).\
\* BTC for funding your miner.

### Create f2pool Account

Sign up to f2pool via this link: [https://www.f2pool.com/](https://www.f2pool.com/)

### Set Payout Address

Go to Account Settings>Accounts. Select LTC and set all the payout address. For security reasons, the payouts will not be automatically enabled for at least 24H.

Get Mining Pool Settings

Click on LTC on the upper right corner to view pool settings.

Next, click on the Workers tab. Make sure to take note of the Pool URL, Worker Name and Password. You will be using this later. This is very important to make sure that your miner will be recognized by the pool.

### Create a NiceHash Account

Register with [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/my/register) and complete the verification.

### Fund your NiceHash wallet

Send BTC to your NiceHash wallet. Rentals are all priced in BTC, so it is better to just deposit BTC directly. Wait for confirmation until the balance shows up on your wallet.

Wait for confirmation until the balance shows up on your wallet. It usually takes 3 confirmations.

### Setup a Mining Order

Click on the Hashpower Marketplace, and select Scrypt.&#x20;

Choose between EU and USA locations. If you are going to use a mining pool that is located in the EU, then it would be best to choose a miner in the same location. Click on + New Order and fill up all the required details. This is where you need to set the information that you got from f2pool.

Test the pool. If everything checks out, you will be ready to place an order.

### Place Mining Order

#### Set the BTC/TH/day.&#x20;

This will determine how much you are willing to pay for a TH/day. Choosing a higher amount would usually result to more miners picking up your order, but would also result to getting your order completed quickly.

#### Set the Limit (TH/s).

#### This allows you to set the maximum hashing power that you want to get. Remember that the higher the hashing power, the more shares you get from the pool. Every pool has a different estimated reward depending on how much hashing power you're miners are running.

#### Set Amount

Input how much BTC you are going to allocate for this order.

Place the order and wait for the miners to pick it up. Since this is similar to an auction, the miners will prioritize orders that would entail them the maximum profit.

Congratulations, you are now mining Litecoin including Dogecoin and Bellscoin. You can also monitor progress of your miner/worker on f2pool and see estimated rewards.
