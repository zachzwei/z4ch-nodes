# Merge Mining LTC+DOGE+BEL

**Disclaimer**:\
The following guide is based on my personal experience not to be taken as financial advise. Mining cryptocurrencies does not always result to an immediate return of investment. If you understand the risk and would like to know the procedure, then read on.\
The guide covers setting up an account, payment address and configuring your mining pool settings.

### Requirements

\* A [ViaBTC](https://www.viabtc.com/signup?refer=1777107) account or any mining pool that supports merge mining.\
\* An ASIC cloud mining service like [Nicehash](https://www.nicehash.com/).\
\* A crypto wallet that support LTC and DOGE ([Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)) and BEL ([Nintondo](https://nintondo.io/)).\
\* BTC for funding your miner.

### Create ViaBTC Account

Sign up to ViaBTC via this [link](https://www.viabtc.com/signup?refer=1777107). \
Note:\
This includes my referral ID.

### Set Automatic Withdrawal Address

Once you create an account on ViaBTC, your mining rewards will automatically go to the Assets section. Click on the "Assets" tab to view them.

Click on "Auto-Withdrawal Setting" to set an Address for the crypto that will be automatically sent to your own wallet or to your CoinEX address. Auto withdrawal will only happen based on the limit that you set. For example, LTC rewards will be automatically withdrawn when it reaches 0.1 LTC.

Note:

Create a Miner ID in the based on your account name (example: z4ch or z4ch.workerID) and any password for it. WorkerID should consist of numbers and lowercase letters no longer than 64 characters.



### Create a NiceHash Account

Register with [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/my/register) and complete the verification.

### Fund your NiceHash wallet

Send BTC to your NiceHash wallet. Rentals are all priced in BTC, so it is better to just deposit BTC directly. Wait for confirmation until the balance shows up on your wallet.

Wait for confirmation until the balance shows up on your wallet. It usually takes 3 confirmations.

### Setup a Mining Order

Click on the Hashpower Marketplace, and select Scrypt.&#x20;

Choose between EU and USA locations. If you are going to use a mining pool that is located in the EU, then it would be best to choose a miner in the same location. Click on + New Order and fill up all the required details. This is where you need to set the information that you got from [ViaBTC](https://www.viabtc.com/signup?refer=1777107).

Test the pool. If everything checks out, you will be ready to place an order.

If you are encountering errors with the Pool difficulty, set it to d=500000

### Place Mining Order

#### Set the BTC/TH/day.&#x20;

This will determine how much you are willing to pay for a TH/day. Choosing a higher amount would usually result to more miners picking up your order, but would also result to getting your order completed quickly.

#### Set the Limit (TH/s).

#### This allows you to set the maximum hashing power that you want to get. Remember that the higher the hashing power, the more shares you get from the pool. Every pool has a different estimated reward depending on how much hashing power you're miners are running.

#### Set Amount

Input how much BTC you are going to allocate for this order.

Place the order and wait for the miners to pick it up. Since this is similar to an auction, the miners will prioritize orders that would entail them the maximum profit.
